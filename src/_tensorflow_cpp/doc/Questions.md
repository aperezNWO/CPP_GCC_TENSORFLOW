Hi Qwen. I have a full stack project with the following features

  - Angular Frontend.
  - .NET    Backend
  - Codesandbox hosted backend (node.js, python, springboot)
  - c++ compiled dll exposed through .NET backend via dllimport.
  - MS SQL Server database hosted remotely.
  
The program has the following group of components


1. Miscelaneous

    1.1  OCR demo using the camera or a drawing pad
         - Library : Tessseract for c++ via .net core backend dllimport.
		 - Library : Tesseract for javascript via node.js backend.
    1.2  Shape recognition using the camera or a drawing path
         - Library : Opencv for c++ via .net core backend dllimport.
         - Library : Opencv for Angular / Typescript
    1.3  Math demo using math.js library.
	1.4  Collision demo using html  canvas.
	1.5  Fractal demo using Opencv for c++ via .net core backend dllimport.
	1.6. Chat demo using socket.io  

2. file format demos

    2.2 Form which queries a remote database, shows the result in a grid, imports to csv format.
    2.3 pdf export generation sample using iTextSharp.
    2.4 Chart demo using chart.js library ( pie chart , bar chart).

3. Algorithms

    3.1 Dijkstra demo which put random points and connnections and search the shorstes distance from
        one defined point to other
        Backend : Springboot, c++, C#.
    3.2 Regular Expression demo. Search into a xml document via regex tag.
        Backend : C++ and c#
    3.3 Sort Benchmar,.  Sorts a shuffled ist of 25 sequential numbers
        Backend : C++ and c#
      
4. Games

    3.1  Hanoi Towers challenge 2d using canvas html and observables
    3.2  Hanoi Towers challenge 3d using TWEEN library
    3.3  Sudoku autogenerated and ajuto solved
         backend: c++ and node.js
    3.4  Tic tac Toe with Typescript engine, playing user against machine.
    3.5  Tic tac Toe a.i. using one the following resources 
         
		 - Tensorflow
         - c++ neural network from scratch.

 My question is if you please can list a pensum of machine learning, deep learning and tensorflow indicating
 which component of thie fullstack may apply or if better to add one (i.e. chess a.i.)

-- [_] MACHINE LEARNING PENSUM QUESIION

      -- [_] I had a c++ code which showcase the usage of a neural network with a tic tac toe autoplay. Also I have a c++ code which showcase the usage of genetic algorithms with a tetris autoplay. Both does not rely on prebuilt a.i. or g.a. libraries but on pure math logic. Despite of the existance of prebuilt libraries for machine learning, can you advise me on one or several excersices the simplest as possible to showcase the fundamentals of mschine learning using the same aproach (no prebuilt libraries, just pure math and c++ logic)?
